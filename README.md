This project is a starter template for a Docsy Jekyll theme, designed for native deployment on GitHub Pages.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to provide a user-friendly, feature-rich, and easily maintainable platform for creating documentation websites using Jekyll.

## Features

-   **User Interaction:** Consistent permalinks, easy linking to GitHub issues for questions, and direct file editing on GitHub.
-   **Search:** Comprehensive search functionality across all site pages, with the option to exclude specific content from search.
-   **External Search:** The ability to link any page tag to trigger an external search.
-   **Documentation:** A structured documentation collection that's easy to organize on the filesystem, render with nested headings, and reference in markdown.
-   **Pages:** A dedicated section for more traditional pages like "About".
-   **Navigation:** Full control over the main navigation on the left side, along with automatic generation of a table of contents on the right.
-   **News:** A dedicated posts feed for news and updates, with archive options organized by year.
-   **Templates:** Easy-to-use includes that simplify the creation of alerts, documentation links, and other content.
